AppleScript

Accessibility Inspector
-----------------------

1. "Accessibility Inspector" is a little utility bundled in OSX (or perhaps its in xcode - not sure). It gives a lot of information about whatever UI element in any window that your mouse is currently over.
2. "entire contents" of allows you to dump all UI elements in a given scope when using the Applescript Editor. For example if I inserted get entire contents of window "Sharing" in the appropriate place in this script, it would list out all UI elements of the window "sharing" in the events panel of the Applescript editor.
